# An OTP-Based-Secure-Online-Transaction-System-Using-Face-Recognition
This Project orchestrates a secure transaction process, employing OTP verification and facial recognition technologies. Initially, it retrieves the sender's  details from a file and prompts for confirmation. Subsequently, an OTP is generated and sent to the sender for authentication. Upon validation, the project  utilizes facial recognition algorithms to confirm the sender's presence, capturing an image for verification. Once sender authentication is successful, receiver  details are extracted from a CSV file, with validation against the input receiver's phone number. If confirmed, the sender inputs the transaction amount, and if all 
details align, the transaction proceeds. Transaction metadata, including sender and receiver information, amount, and timestamp, are logged for record-keeping.
Functionalities include OTP generation and verification, real-time facial recognition, CSV data parsing, and transaction logging. This script provides a comprehensive solution for secure transactions, enhancing security and trust in digital financial transactions.
